# Barcode Buddy for Grocy

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/barcodebuddy-documentation/badge/?version=latest)](https://barcodebuddy-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) 

### Available for:

- Bare Metal
- [Docker](https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy-docker)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bulling.barcodebuddyscanner)

## About

Pass barcodes to Barcode Buddy. If already in [Grocys](https://github.com/grocy/grocy) system, it will consume/add/open the product in Grocy. If an unknown barcode is passed, the product name will be looked up and a corresponding product can be chosen in the Web UI. Tags can be saved - if a new product contains the tag in the name, the product will be already preselected in the drop-down list.

## Prerequisites

Webserver that supports PHP (eg. NGINX, Apache) or Docker, a [Grocy](https://github.com/grocy/grocy) API key and ideally a barcode scanner or Android phone

## Getting Started

Refer to the [documentation](https://barcodebuddy-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), on how to install the program. Installation can be done in a couple of minutes.

### Usage

Barcodes can either manually be added to the programm or the process can be automated by grabbing the input from the scanner.

Refer to the [documentation](https://barcodebuddy-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), on how to use the program.
